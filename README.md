# The task
Create a booking application for general use with NodeJS
Our PoC is to created a booking app by hardcoding a simple app

## What we did
1. We created a json file to store a booking made by the user input and then sent that to the json file overwriting the previous data.
2. We created a simple login app using some if statements.
3. To show the bookings we created a simple table and in the cell we fetched the data from the json file and showed using js. 

## Improvments
1. Using Google sheets instead of a json file.
2. Using Google api for the login app.
3. Using Google api calendar for the booking app.

## Notes
This example is just some hardcoding that has the purpose to prove our PoC, also note that we don't put any energy into css only the functionality.
